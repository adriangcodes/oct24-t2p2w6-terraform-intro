Basic infrastructure provisioning via Terraform and GitHub actions

Automating the provisioning of an S3 bucket.

terraform init - initialises terraform for local usage with the modules from the terraform file
terraform plan - generate the steps of the infrastructure automation, but won't actually apply those steps yet
terraform apply - run the steps generated by the plan command
terraform destroy - undo everything set up
